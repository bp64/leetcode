# Testcase Example:  '"sadbutsad"\n"sad"'
#
# Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first
# occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
# Output: 0
# Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
# The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
# Output: -1
# Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 10^4
# haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.
#
#
#

class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        # 1
        # python implementation -- 72%
        return haystack.find(needle)
