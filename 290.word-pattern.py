# Testcase Example:  '"abba"\n"dog cat cat dog"'
#
# Given a pattern and a string s, find if sÂ follows the same pattern.
#
# Here follow means a full match, such that there is a bijection between a
# letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat dog"
# Output: true
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: pattern = "abba", s = "dog cat cat fish"
# Output: false
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: pattern = "aaaa", s = "dog cat cat dog"
# Output: false
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= pattern.length <= 300
# pattern contains only lower-case English letters.
# 1 <= s.length <= 3000
# s contains only lowercase English letters and spaces ' '.
# s does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
# All the words in s are separated by a single space.
#

class Solution:
    def wordPattern(self, pattern: str, s: str) -> bool:
        # 1
        # O(n)
        # similar to isomorphic-strings
        # split s by white space
        # iterate through pattern, track mappings from chars to words and words to chars
        # if word or char isn't in lookup, insert the map, ie. write once
        # then check what is in the lookup conforms with the current word
        # and vice versa
        words = s.split()
        if len(pattern) != len(words):
            return False

        lookup = {}

                lookup[c] = words[i]

                rlookup[words[i]] = c
            if (lookup[c] != words[i]) or (rlookup[words[i]] != c):
